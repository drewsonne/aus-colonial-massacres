Machine readable version and basic reporting Colonial Australian Massacres 


This data was extracted from the timeline at [Colonial Frontier Massacres in Australia, 1788-1930](https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/)
in a project funded by [Australian Research Council](https://www.arc.gov.au/).

## Generation

All the code for generation can be found in [the jupyter notebook](analyses.ipynb).

## Usage

A machine-readable version of the data can be found in this repository at [aus-colonial-massacres.json](aus-colonial-massacres.json) this version preserves the original 
structure of the data as extracted from the page above. A second file [aus-colonial-massacres-cleaned.json](aus-colonial-massacres-cleaned.json) has taken liberties with the
structure and formatting of the data to provide a more machine readable version.
